<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pediatric Breathing Circuits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-open Type</li><li>Close Type</li><li>Open Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pediatric breathing circuits market comprises three main types: semi-open, closed, and open circuits. Semi-open circuits allow some gas escape while maintaining a connection to the ventilator, providing flexibility and reduced dead space. Closed circuits are designed to minimize gas loss and are often used in controlled environments to improve patient safety and gas exchange. Open circuits offer direct exposure to the atmosphere, facilitating simpler setups but potentially increasing the risk of contamination and gas loss. Each type serves specific clinical needs in pediatric respiratory care.</p></p>
