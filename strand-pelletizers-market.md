<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Strand Pelletizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Cut Strand Pelletizer</li><li>Dry Cut Strand Pelletizer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Strand pelletizers are essential in the plastic recycling and manufacturing process, offering two main types: wet cut and dry cut. Wet cut strand pelletizers utilize water to cool and cut the strands of melted polymer into pellets, ensuring minimal dust and enhancing pellet quality. In contrast, dry cut strand pelletizers rely on air and mechanical cutting, resulting in a faster process but often producing more fines. Both types cater to different production needs, influencing efficiency and pellet characteristics.</p></p>
